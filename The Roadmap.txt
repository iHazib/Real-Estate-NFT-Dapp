The Roadmap
Phase 1: Smart Contract Refactoring & Local Testing
Goal: Modify your contract to allow dynamic roles (not hardcoded) and write a test script to prove it works locally.
Why: We never go to Sepolia until logic works locally.
Phase 2: Sepolia Configuration & Deployment
Goal: Get your API keys, set up the config, and put the contract on the internet.
Phase 3: Frontend Skeleton & Wallet Connection
Goal: Set up React and write the specific code to connect MetaMask using Ethers.js.
Phase 4: UI Integration
Goal: Display your JSON data and make the buttons actually call the smart contract.
Phase 5: Live Deployment
Goal: Push to GitHub and deploy on Vercel/Netlify.
